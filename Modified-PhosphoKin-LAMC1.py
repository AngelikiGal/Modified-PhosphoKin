# 1st Function: Tool for searching kinase binding sites and potential phosphorylated residues in a protein. 
# 2nd Funtion: This scripts also categorizes the phosphorylated residues according to their location relatively to the proteins' known active sites (inside of, close to within six residues proximity and outside of active sites).
# 3rd Function: This script also links kinases to active sites according to the phosphorylated residues they are responsible for and shows their activity inside of, close to and outside of active sites.
# 4th Function: This script finds the possibly responsible kinases for the experimentally observed phosphorylated residues in a protein according to kinases' binding motifs.
# 5th Function: This script identifies the missense point mutations that have been found in cancer patients and possibly disturb the predicted phosphorylation of the protein by either not allowing kinase binding or the phosphorylation according to kinases' motifs.

### Note: the kinase motifs are traslated to regular expressions
#### Input: a Sequence.txt file, an Active_sites.txt, an exp_phospho.txt file, a Motifs.txt file and a Mutation.xlxs file.
#### OUTPUT: Five output files; one for the 1st function (.txt file), one for the 2nd function (.txt file), one for the 3rd function (.txt file), one for the 4th function (.txt file) and one for the 5th function (.xls file).

# Edit: 29/6/2019 by Panagiota-Aggeliki Galliou (ag.gal.work@gmail.com)
## changes: -included important residues for kinases motifs, -included recognizing missense point mutations from a file and matching them to the proteins' active sites, kinases' binding sites and phosphorylations, identifying those mutations that possibly disturb the phoshporylation of the protein according to kinases' motifs either by changing an important residue for kinase binding or by changing the residue to be phosphorylated. 
# Edit: 10/7/2019 by Panagiota-Aggeliki Galliou (ag.gal.work@gmail.com)
## changes: -included the Tyrosine Kinases and Tyrosines phosphorylated residues. So the find_phospho_indexes_in_a_motif(motif) function was changed to identify pY as phosphorylated residues in order to recognise the motifs of Tyrosine Kinases.
# Last Edit: 08/01/2020 by Panagiota-Aggeliki Galliou (ag.gal.work@gmail.com)
## changes: -changed the comments and the prints to contain more details and to be more specific,
